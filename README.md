# Clean Water Analysis
<h3>Idea</h3><hr>
We need to create a website in which we have connected the MYQL database with the website using PHP and storing the data in the database. We need to create a machine learning model which will predict whether the water is safe for drinking or not. The data will be taken from the user and drinking quality of water will be predicted through the machine learning model.

<h3>The Highlights of my project</h3>

The first page of our website tell us the services provided.<br><br>

We have predicted whether the water is safe or not by training a machine learning model(Random Forest Classifier) and the data from the database provided by the user in form 1 will also be predicted.<br>
